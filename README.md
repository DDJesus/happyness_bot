# happyness_bot
This bot is just a direct copy of the avgcomment_bot, but automated and doesn't wait for a summon and it doesn't reply to comments. Strictly used for Data Analysis. Stores the Flesch-Kincaid readability level of all comments, the date the comment was posted, and the subreddit the comment was posted in to a SQLite DB for later reference.
